NBNB:
SEE NOTE IN CAPITALS BELOW.



void processState(State* s, unsigned char* _data, NEIGHBOUR_ADDR _if)
strlen(_data) is used



trie* trie_add(trie *t, const char *str, int object)
strlen(str) is used
in this trie it is Ok because it doesn't include data



trie* trie_lookup_longest_prefix_extra2(trie *t, const char *str)
uses strlen(str)
this method does not appear to be used!!!

trie* trie_lookup2(trie *t, const char *str)
strlen(str)
just used in handle_advert to lookup  context so ok


void new_one(trie *t, const char *str, NEIGHBOUR_ADDR _if)
uses strlen(str)
this method does not appear to be used!!!


unsigned char* write_packet()
strlen((const char*)outgoing_packet.data)
should be setting length correctly before write_packet is called


void ucast_best_gradient(State* s, unsigned char* _data, NEIGHBOUR_ADDR _if)
strlen(queue) - same thing as strlen(_data) see callee
probably should pass in length?
OR...  Does it really matter since it is state/gradient NOT data that is being checked


NOTE:
========
NBNBNB:
THINK ABOUT ALL THIS AGAIN, WE ONLY NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN THIS AFFECTS THE READING
OF THE DATA BEING SENT
ALL  (YES ALL) STATE NAMES HELD ON RECORDWILL NOT HAVE ZEROS!!!!!
