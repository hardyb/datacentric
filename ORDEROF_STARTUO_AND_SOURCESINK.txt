DC
=====
startup first

source (or sink) 2nd

- startup doesn't send pub source grad cos its not been added in yet
it just sends neighbour bcast
it's not until another neighbour's neighbour bcast is received very shortly after
that this node sends the pub source grad

This only works because all the others are starting up at the same time
If the pub source / record sink node started up last it would not send its grads
because wearesource or wearesink would not be executed until AFTER startup is called!!!

However if we put it the other way round then will it affect AODV cos it will be attempted
to send service discovery etc BEFORE radio is ON.  Or will it just bufferin the mac?

***** NEED TO FIND A WAY TO CORRECT THIS SOON.

It works OK in Waspmote necause the weAre functions are all called BEFORE the startup


AODV
=====

startup first

source (or sink) 2nd


- startup just turns on radio
- for aodv with bind with source on, the sink will issue a service discovery
message then send a bind req to the subsequent source


In the case of initialise stages I think it is clear that later stage
sends with no delay will get delivered later
actually I think if the event has the same delivery time then it is really when the event is added
that influences the order of delivery so even if at the same stage the order of send is important

THE BUG - that we encountered is that startup is done at stage 1 and so parameter nodeStartTime is read
at stage 1 but if region reference host is used then it is still default ie zero











=================================
Try to think whether current DC results will be wrong
=================================

Not quite the same 

the gradient sending and route establishment would have all been at time
zero because the nodestarttime parameter is accessed before it is set through region host

but

SO...  It is worth doing them again.



========================
AND ANOTHER THING
========================

WE have made it possible for first come first served best route like the aodv used 
with zigbee simulation but we think we still operate the wait for time limit reached
between better gradient notifications

NEED TO CHECK whether this is placing more than appropriate time constraint 
and thereby scewing results
