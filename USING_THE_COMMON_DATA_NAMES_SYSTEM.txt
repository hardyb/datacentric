Using the common data names system for Data centric or AODV
==============================================================


Data Centric
=============




AODV - Binding based
=========================


if we set wearesource 
======================
then a data binding without address
is created by the source at start up
this data binding has the data hierachy from the ini
and the longest context

if we are sink
===============
then a service discover packet is sent
this pkt has the data hierachy from the ini
and the longest context (currently at least - is this right?)

process
========
if the source receives a service discovery that is a prefix
of both its own data and its own context then service discover confirmation
is sent

if the source receives a binding request that is a prefix
of both its own data and its own context then binding confirmation
is sent and any matching queued data and future data


NB: AODV Does not restrict any control packets within regions

AODV - Control Unit based
==========================
