These are with 1.0mw power

**.TransmissionAntennaGainIndB = -2.5dB 
**.ReceiveAntennaGainIndB = -2.5dB

The digi doc says on chip surface mounted antenna -1.5dbi
not sure if this would be the same as setting -1.5db in the above parameters




and 0.040 to 0.042 delay on reading incoming data
and 0.040 to 0.042 delay on sending data

Also now corrected to 0.2s convergence timeout
as being used on hardware
