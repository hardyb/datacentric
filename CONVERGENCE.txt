So...


what is convergence
what should we be measuring to get ideas about convergence time?




current graph is for sending bcast interests!!
so it just gives a basic idea
also it effectively shows receipt of a 'best' updating
interest since the interest is forwarded.
Now...
After completion of sending of around 100 updates
at around 1.35s only 6 more nodes make updates (ie forward on the interest)
from 1.35s till nearly 1.60s







we could do the same for arrivals 
and we could do the same for arrivals that result in
a change





our graph for number of interest arrivals for each module is recording
before the filtering out for lqi/table size







===========================



some things we could record:

current inter-arrival time at each point in time
maybe will see if they getting closer together
or further apart and what the shortest/longest inter-arrival time is

Also inter-arrival time of impacting interests (ie ones that are forwarded).





it MAY be that the the 'best' path value is delivered accross the network
in a wave and that although the overall convergence takes a while we can
say something about convergence from its start to its finish at any one
given node    ????



NEED TO SET A TIME TO SEND REINFORCEMENT
then need to record convergence time

then e2e delay without failing nodes
then with failing nodes - be careful previously up/down too frequent
then with failing nodes and stability link cost
then do processor link cost

(need to remove the sending of interests by the recently back up node - to much activity
just ammend network after a breakage)


we can check that we are in fact setting the pkt size correctly
