now all done in app module

nodestarttime currently 1s
enables phy module for send/recv
calls startup ie sends neighbour bcast

schedulestarttime  currently 3s
starts the sending of data according to complete

reinforced advs and ints



net module runs a self message

starting first AFTER 2s

this picks up on the need to reinforce
adverts
collaberations ( needs some corrections - remove data send code? )
interests
