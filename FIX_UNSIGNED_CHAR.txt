assignments signed to unsigned and unsigned to signed retains bit pattern
not sure about passing into functions

key issue is comparison
they must be being treated as identical types for the comparison 
result to be accurate

#defines are unsigned char/int

in the long term we need to make all the stuff
to do with the elements of the tries unsigned char
