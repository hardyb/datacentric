NB

The multiple calls that we have seen to send_queued_data
may be calls at each node that is converging, but why would 
every node have data?


BUT the following may still be a problem

we put data in the queue when there is no reinforcement

when the queue times out we iterate the queue
attempting for each to pkt to send it again

we only remove it from the queue if we successfully send it
but if we don't successfully send it then in consider_sending_data()
we are putting it in again so we end up with multiple copies

perhaps we should remove from queue before attempting to send
then if we cannot send we put it back into the queue again

alternatively we only add to the queue what is not already in it


if we are adding to the queue from inside a queue traversal
how will this impact things?

when we add we change only the link field of the last item
and then point it to the new item


perhaps we should have a timeout for a specific pkt not just the state
and its whole queue
