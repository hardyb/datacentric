so


check that handle int and adv are setup correctly for 
in and out link cost

think these are ok






initially have NO nodes set to go down - set all nodes to VERY stable
set to just use lqi - OK
set some pubs and record sinks and sources - 

we have set context by selecting specific nodes
but now we need to set by region



compile

run to completion of reinforcement
and watch that data arrives ok



crashes at end of action file

how do we represent zero in the data string?
is it there any way and just not in bubble?





try to graph this some how
