Q&As:




Q.  when is non volatile function called, on first par call or when owning module is constructed or what?

A.  When module is constructed before any initialisation and the value is then set as a constant from ned or from ini if overrides

Q.  Are there any other volatile parameters or in program random based calls (so effectively volatile) which may affect a differencebetween equal replicas with incr numNodes?

A.   Yes, routingDelay in bcast and ucast udp and data centric packets.  Can't find any others which seem significant though


Q.  Do we think it is (from time to time) just caused by the additional node?

A.  Possibly caused by the volatile routingDelay in the question above.  Try that first then address this question.
