range 1 - 9


multiply by path cost
which if we use the outgoing path cost will always be at least 1





oh hang on the path cost is not just 1..7 or 0..7 it will be much larger

so how do we arrive at a suitable jitter?

let us say the network size is 250 and the rough maximum hops is 16


we could divide 64 by 16

= 4



so 1 hop @ cost 1 = 1
16 hops @ cost 7 = 112



nwk size 1000
rough max hops = 32
32 * 7 = 224



500 size = 22 hops

22 * 7 = 154


so 64 / 154



154/64 = 2.4



CHANGE OF PLAN
==================

We don't think it means this.

We now think it means adjust the jitter BASED ON THE LINK COST

SO THAT!

frames arriving with high path cost will have been delayed more than those with lower
path cost


So...

if we use the incoming link cost
i.e. 1..7

we should still do random jitter but in seven ranges

so the range should be

1..9
10..18
19..27
28..36
37..45
46..54
55..63


so the calculation is

from = 1 + (lc-1)*9
to   = lc * 9

jitter = 2 * intuniform(1 + (lc-1)*9, lc * 9)
