What about interests in all of this reinforce retry stuff?

so say we send an interest the srcs receive interest and 
send reinforcement AND first data (here reinf only necessary for 
completeness) repeat not required if data fails then breakage sent and
new interest



SO... we DO NOT do retries of reinforcements for interests










when do we reset the retries to zero?


advert/interest retry
newly up


reinforce retry
we are reinforcing ONE PARTICULAR intr/adv
so, if there is a new instance of the same intr/adv
e.g. after a break, then we need to do fresh
reinforce (new route?) and give it a number of tries if
necessary
SO..
we know this by the fresh seqno, so if there is a new seqno then
reset the retry count
AND...
When newly up?





==================================

we send out an advert
1

we send reinf 1
no data
send anotherreinf 2
